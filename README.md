## Programs

### Binary Search
Design and develop an assembly language program to search a key element 'X' in a list of 'n'16-bit numbers. Adopt Binary search algorithm in your program for searching.

---
### Bubble Sort
Design and develop an assembly program to sort a given set of 'n' 16-bit numbers in ascending order. Adopt Bubble Sort algorithm to sort given elements.

---
### Check Palindrome
Develop an assembly language program to reverse a given string and verify whether it is a palindrome or not. Display the appropriate Message.

---
### nCr
Develop an assembly language program to compute nCr using recursive procedure. Assume that 'n' and 'r' are non-negative integers.

---
### Current Date and Time
Design and develop an assembly language program to read the current time and Date from the system and display it in the standard format on the screen.
