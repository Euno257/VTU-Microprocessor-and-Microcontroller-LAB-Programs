## Programs

### Binary Search
Design and develop an assembly language program to search a key element 'X' in a list of 'n'16-bit numbers. Adopt Binary search algorithm in your program for searching.

### Bubble Sort
Design and develop an assembly program to sort a given set of 'n' 16-bit numbers in ascending order. Adopt Bubble Sort algorithm to sort given elements.

---
### Check Palindrome
Develop an assembly language program to reverse a given string and verify whether it is a palindrome or not. Display the appropriate Message.

---
### nCr
Develop an assembly language program to compute nCr using recursive procedure. Assume that 'n' and 'r' are non-negative integers.
